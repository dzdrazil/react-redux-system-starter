# react-redux-system-starter
*not* setup as isomorphic

This is a rough outline of a project setup with:

* Airbnb eslint config
* Babel 6.1.2
* gulp
* browserify

TODO:

- [x] Add react router
- [ ] Integrate react-router into redux state using redux router?
- [x] Add some async actions
- [ ] (Follow this issue)[https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/2645] and upgrade babel version when appropriate to get decorator support back
- [ ] Implement PostCSS or SASS
- [ ] Implement some smart and dumb components
  * Redux explanation (here)[http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html]
  * Generic React best practice explanation (here)[https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0]
- [ ] Fix the Gulpfile
  * basic build task doesn't end (at least on Winwodws)
  * Add in other requisite tasks to support SASS / PostCSS
- [ ] Add basic assets such as a favicon
